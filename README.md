# Clima ‚òÅ

## Our Goal

Clima is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-) which tells us live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
Time consuming tasks are tackled usign asynchronous programming in dart, with beautiful UI's in flutter.
